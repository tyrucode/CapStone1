Spotify Snippet Guessing Game!

This is my so far biggest project yet, a game involving the use of Spotifys Api.
The game is simple, you select a playlist/album/genre, and some songs will play from it. 
Your job is to hear the snippet, and make a guess at what the name of the song is, the catch is though if you get it wrong 3 times you are out. 
Compete with your friends to see who can guess the most songs.
See how high you can rank on the leaderboard!

More features coming soon, app is a complete WIP.
